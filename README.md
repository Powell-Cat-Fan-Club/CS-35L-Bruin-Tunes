# CS 35L: BruinTunes #
## Description ##
Spotify is good, but it could be better. Imagine a platform where you could discuss your favorite artists and music with other people in addition to listening to your favorite songs. Introducing… BruinTunes™!!! BruinTunes is like Spotify, but better. You can share your unique perspectives on diverse genres of music and discuss your favorite artists and albums with like-minded people. 

BruinTunes will be a web-based application that hosts the links to your favorite music on its platform, along with a few other features. You can find some of the most popular artists through tags like genres, decade, and more. Additionally, you can comment on and like certain artists and their songs, as well as like other people’s comments. Finally, you can make lists and rankings of your favorite music, although this won’t be tied to an account.

Our motivation for this project is to create a platform for UCLA students to share their music with each other. As music lovers ourselves, we want a platform where anyone can find information about new artists and discover new songs. Spotify is great for listening to music and making playlists. However, there’s no good way to comment on and make lists of your favorite music. Additionally, with YouTube’s choice to remove comments on “Artist - Topic” channels, it’s a lot harder to be social with your music. Music is one way of communicating with other people, and that’s a void BruinTunes will fill.

### Notes for Team Members ###
## Getting Started ##
Clone the repository using `git clone {url of repository}` to the terminal of your choice (VS Code is what I use, but you can use whatever you want). Once you have done this, `cd` into the new folder and type in `npm install`. This installs the dependencies of the project (outlined in package.json). Finally, type `npm start` to run the project in your browser. Let me know if you have trouble with the above steps.
## Advice ##
When in doubt, follow what the TAs said in discussion. This is:
- Write good commit messages.
- Make a branch every time you want to modify something in `main`. Make sure that you are in your branch and not in the `main` branch!
- Make a branch every time you switch tasks (i.e. if you're working on a css file but want to switch to working on ranking, make a new branch with your name and the function. 
- You can create `pull` requests in order to 
- Use `.gitignore` for node_modules (note for self). 
- When in doubt, look to the internet (or the advice of the TAs!). Ask the Discord for help. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
